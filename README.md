# DragonWars

Text Based Dragon Collection Game in the Style of Pokémon, for CMSC 202, Spring 2018 (Computer Science II for Majors)

This text based project was built in C++ to replicate a Pokémon in text format. Players can take the following actions:
- search for eggs of different rarities 
- hatch eggs into dragons
- display all their eggs/dragons
- attack other dragons

The game implements features like running from battle, special attacks that kill opposing dragons regardless of level, and leveling up schemes.
